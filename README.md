# Bikesharing_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to examine bike-sharing data in New York to determine whether it was feasible to start a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. We created visuals using Tableau showing the following:
- Peak riding hours in the month of August
- Bike checkout times for overall users as well as genders
- Customer type demographic
- Heatmap showing most active time of day during the week broken down by overall users and genders

## Results

### Customer Breakdown
There were 2,344,224 trips taken during the month of August.
81.07% of trips were taken by subscribers and 18.93% were taken by non-subscribers.

### Additional Analysis
1. I would recommend performing an analysis on the entire year rather than a specific month to provide greater insight as to whether it would be a good idea to start a bike-sharing program in Des Moines.
2. An additional visualization I would create would be counting how many start locations are also the end locations for trips. This would provide insight as to the number of stations needed for the program.
